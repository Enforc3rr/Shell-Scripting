# Shell Scripting 

#### What is Bash And Shell ?
- Bash is considered to be a terminal instance which gives us much more streamlined way of using unix/linux OS.
- Shell is basically interpreter of commands.

#### Basic Linux Commands - 
- `cd` to change directory
- `pwd` to get the current working directory
- `ls` to list out items
- `cp` to copy files 
- `mv` to move files 
- `rm` to remove files 
- `echo` basically System.out.println of linux world
- `mkdir` to create a directory 
- `touch` to make a file
- `chmod` to change/set file permissions 



## Important Things To Note - 

- First thing which we do is we define which Interpreter are we gonna use. It is defined using ` #! ` Also Known as Shebang and It is followed by location of the interpreter i.e. `#!/bin/bash`.


## Basics of Shell Scripting -

#### Variables - 
- ` NAME="This is a variable" ` or `SPORT="Base"`
- To Print out that variable `echo "Variable = $NAME" ` OR `echo $NAME`.
- We also sometimes surround the variable with {} if we want to concatinate something to the value of variable e.g. `echo ${SPORT}ball` // It will print out = `Baseball`.
